# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

MARIO VERTICAL OR MARIO Y

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A version of mario where it is based on the Y axis moving up, rather than moving along the x axis to the right. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am planning to have it spawn your character in a randomly generated level that will always be different. You will spawn on a 
row of blocks to keep you from falling through the map. You will have to move upwards through the level to reach a flag at the
top of the map height. I will also be changing sprites and music from original mario cs50 project. When you reach the flag, it 
will spawn you in another randomly generated level, different than the one before. I am hoping to make it an enjoyable game 
that always provides a challenge. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Make things based more upon the y-axis rather than just the x. Camera follows character on both axis. Change sprites and music to make it customizable. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have randomly generated blocks that get you to the top of the level. Have level reset every time to make it fresh. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have the flag spawn at the top, and make it always reachable. Basically the original mario but completely vertical instead of horizontal

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to get a better grasp on Lua programming, as I am not used to the language and need to know how to impliment my changes to the game. 
I will need to study Lua sites and videos demoing its different features and how to use them. I will also need to research Mario bros. to get the
physics for the game working. I will be working on this alone.

Mario-Y
Mario but moving along Y axis.

Ran into difficulty making it completely on the Y-Axis, so I compromised and made it the original mario flag location but with greater use of jumps and a ton of random block generation. There are more gaps in the floor to give an incentive to jumping through the sky blocks. Very clunky, but works the way it is intended. Level resets and generates another random level when you reach the flag, so it never gets old and is never the same. Enjoy and thanks for a great semester!

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Although I have not solidly decided on any one idea for the project, I am balancing and considering a few. I most likely will choose the games track next week, so I will likely end up making my final
project based on this. I want to focus on something that I have a genuine interest in, so I think that creating something using Mario as a basis would be good for me. I am thinking of maybe 
changing the characters, skins, or physics of the game but everything is still in the very early stages. It all depends on my comfortability with the language after learning it. But, I think 
I have decided that I want to focus on a game and want to do something involving Mario. I want it to be something different from the original game and add a whole new level of playability. 
As I think more about my options, I will focus on a specific change I want to make to Mario. Right now i'm thinking that changing the physics would be incredibly interesting and make the 
game feel alot different.  

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan on working on this project solo. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I honestly have a tough time picking up completely new things, so I would like to know what the most effective way for me to proceed with the games track would be. Is there anything you would 
recommend, whether its a website or videos, etc. if I wanted to seek extra help for it? Thank you in advance.
